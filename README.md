#Rock Paper Scissors
=================

The fifth-week Friday challenge at Makers Academy was to deploy a sinatra-based web application to Heroku in two separate  deployment targets: staging and production.

While the codebase was provided, I added some extra tests and code to include extra weapons in the rock, paper, scissors game: a ninja and a samurai.

The app needed to have the NewRelic add-on, which monitors the app and delivers analytics about its performance. NewRelic allows you to see reports on your app's speed and response time, server performance, if there are any errors, and also what users are doing on your site and which browsers they're using.

Finally, the app needed some css to make it pretty.
